# Sass Landing Page #2

A responsive CSS project using Sass to look at more advanced features and better practices like BEM, custom properties, animations, shape-outside, etc

This project is based on [Kevin Powell](https://github.com/kevin-powell)'s [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1dz0xRbSJc) in [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)'s YT channel and serves as documentation for later, more elaborate, projects.

I left the scss folder exposed since this is purely a Sass project.

You may check it [here](https://shoe-landingpg.hostman.site/).

## What's different from the tutorial?

* Separated scss files 
* Default color setups
* Aligned product details in featured section
* Text aligned to the right in the second shoe article
* Different class names (.shoe-1; .shoe-2.. instead of .shoe-red; .shoe-white..)
